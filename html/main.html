                <p>We are a small keyboard assembling service based in Seattle. Our goal is to spread the joy of keyboards to everyone!
                   We noticed that many people are interested in getting custom mechanical keyboards.
                </p>
                <p>However, the process of sourcing parts, lubing, and assembly can be expensive and time consuming. 
                   Why not just let a bunch of keyboard nerds do all of that hard work for you?
